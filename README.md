#Battleship JavaScript Game

Javascript implementation of the classic board game/Rihanna movie.

To play: Grab a friend (real or imaginary), download this repo and load the game using:
	
	`npm install`

and follow the command line prompts and instructions to continue.

Game experience is enhanced by emphatically declaring your moves as you type them.
