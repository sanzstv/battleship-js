## Rules:
Battleship is a two player game where each player takes turns attempting to sink the other player's ships.

Each player begins with 5 ships each, the grid by default is set to be 8x8.

Every turn, a player gets the chance to choose a spot on the Grid to target. If the grid is occupied, it's a hit.
If it's empty, it's a miss. If the spot has already been called out, then the player must choose another spot.

If all spots a ship occupies are hit, the ship is sunk. The game ends when one player sinks all of the other players' ships.

Grid.js contains configuration of game logic and rules including board size and the ships in play.
