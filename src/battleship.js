Battleship is a two player game where each player takes turns attempting to sink the other player's ships.

Each player begins with 5 ships each, the grid is currently set to be ${app.GRID_SIZE}x${app.GRID_SIZE}.

Every turn, a player gets the chance to choose a spot on the Grid to target. If the grid is occupied, it's a hit.

If it's empty, it's a miss. If the spot has already been called out, then the player must rechoose a spot.

If all spots a ship occupies are hit, the ship is sunk. The game ends when one player sinks all of the other players' ships.

While playing, type 'exit' to quit the game`));
